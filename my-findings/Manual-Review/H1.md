# Sending Native ETH is Not Protected from These Functions: `tillIn` and `withdraw`

### Summary

The `TokenManager` contract contains functions `tillIn` and `withdraw` that handle native ETH transactions. These functions lack adequate access control, which could allow unauthorized users or contracts to deposit or withdraw ETH, potentially compromising the security of the contract.

* [src/core/TokenManager.sol](src/core/TokenManager.sol#L137) [Line: 137](src/core/TokenManager.sol#L137)

## Vulnerability Details

The functions `tillIn` and `withdraw` handle ETH without strict checks on `msg.sender`. The `tillIn` function allows any caller to deposit ETH into the contract, and the `withdraw` function allows any caller to withdraw ETH, assuming the contract's state allows it. This could be exploited by malicious actors to deposit and withdraw ETH without proper authorization.

* **Function `tillIn`:** Allows deposits of ETH without restricting who can call it. The check for sufficient ETH (`msg.value < _amount`) cannot prevent unauthorized deposits.
* **Function `withdraw`:** Allows ETH withdrawals without restricting who can request a withdrawal. This function transfers ETH directly to the `msg.sender`, potentially allowing unauthorized users to claim funds.

## Impact

* **Unauthorized Deposits:** Malicious users could deposit ETH into the contract, potentially crowding out legitimate operations or misappropriating funds.
* **Unauthorized Withdrawals:** Attackers could withdraw ETH without proper authorization, leading to financial loss or unauthorized access to the contract’s funds.

The impact is high as it directly affects the contract's ability to manage ETH securely, risking potential financial losses and undermining the trust in the contract’s operations.

## Tools Used

* **Mythril:** Used for static analysis of the smart contract to identify vulnerabilities.
* **Solidity Compiler (solc):** Compiler used to compile the smart contract and validate its functionality.

## Exploit Code

To demonstrate the potential exploit, here is a simplified contract that interacts with the vulnerable `TokenManager` contract:

```solidity
// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT
pragma solidity ^0.8.13;

import "./TokenManager.sol";

contract MaliciousUser {
    TokenManager public tokenManager;

    constructor(address _tokenManager) {
        tokenManager = TokenManager(_tokenManager);
    }

    // Function to exploit the vulnerability and withdraw ETH
    function exploitWithdraw() external {
        // Assumes the contract has some ETH and the exploit succeeds
        tokenManager.withdraw(address(0), TokenManager.TokenBalanceType.PointToken);
    }

    // Function to exploit the vulnerability and deposit ETH
    function exploitDeposit() external payable {
        // Send ETH to the contract to exploit the tillIn function
        tokenManager.tillIn(address(this), address(0), msg.value, false);
    }
}
```

## Recommendations

1. **Implement Access Control:**

   * Add appropriate access control modifiers (e.g., `onlyOwner` or custom role-based access control) to the `tillIn` and `withdraw` functions. Ensure that only authorized users or contracts can call these functions.

   ```solidity
   modifier onlyAuthorized() {
       require(/* condition for authorized access */, "Not authorized");
       _;
   }

   function tillIn(/* parameters */) external payable onlyAuthorized {
       // Function logic
   }

   function withdraw(/* parameters */) external onlyAuthorized {
       // Function logic
   }
   ```

2. **Verify ETH Handling:**
   * Ensure that ETH deposits and withdrawals are handled securely. Consider adding checks to validate the caller's authorization and to prevent unauthorized access.
