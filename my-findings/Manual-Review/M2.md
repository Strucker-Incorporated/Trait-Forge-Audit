## M[2] - Re-entrancy Eth

The `PreMarkets` smart contract has been identified with reentrancy vulnerabilities in three functions: `abortAskOffer`, `abortBidTaker`, and `closeOffer`. These vulnerabilities can be exploited to manipulate contract state and potentially cause unauthorized fund transfers.

## Vulnerability Details

**Vulnerabilities:**

1. **Reentrancy in `abortAskOffer`**:
   - **Lines Affected:** 536-635
   - **External Call:** `tokenManager.addTokenBalance(...)`
   - **State Variable Written After Call:** `offerInfo.abortOfferStatus`

2. **Reentrancy in `abortBidTaker`**:
   - **Lines Affected:** 645-697
   - **External Call:** `tokenManager.addTokenBalance(...)`
   - **State Variable Written After Call:** `stockInfo.stockStatus`

3. **Reentrancy in `closeOffer`**:
   - **Lines Affected:** 406-460
   - **External Call:** `tokenManager.addTokenBalance(...)`
   - **State Variable Written After Call:** `offerInfo.offerStatus`

**Issue Description:**
These functions are vulnerable because they make external calls before updating state variables. This ordering allows attackers to re-enter the contract during the external call, potentially exploiting the contract's state before it is properly updated.

## Impact

Exploitation of these vulnerabilities can lead to:
- **Unauthorized Fund Transfers:** Attackers can exploit the contract to withdraw or misappropriate funds.
- **State Manipulation:** Attackers can alter the contract's state in an unintended manner, leading to possible denial of service or incorrect functionality.
- **Financial Loss:** Users or the contract owner could suffer financial losses due to the reentrancy attacks.

## Tools Used

- **Solidity:** For writing and deploying the smart contract.
- **Remix IDE:** For developing and testing the smart contract code.
- **Ethers.js / Web3.js:** For interacting with the Ethereum blockchain and smart contracts.
- **Custom Exploit Contract:** Used to demonstrate and exploit the reentrancy vulnerabilities.

## Recommendations

1. **Use Checks-Effects-Interactions Pattern:** 
   - Ensure that state changes are performed before making any external calls to mitigate the risk of reentrancy attacks.

2. **Implement Reentrancy Guards:**
   - Use reentrancy guards (e.g., the `nonReentrant` modifier) to prevent reentrant calls and protect against such attacks.

3. **Review and Refactor Code:**
   - Thoroughly review and refactor the contract code to follow best practices for security and ensure that all external calls are made after state changes.

4. **Conduct Comprehensive Testing:**
   - Perform extensive testing, including automated and manual tests, to identify and address potential vulnerabilities before deployment.
